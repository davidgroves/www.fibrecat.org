## What is the problem ?

This isn't exclusively a problem for games, it is a problem for almost any software. It is by
far and away most noticable for games though. There many reasons why this may be the  case.

### Broken DRM.

Some games have DRM features, which no longer work. Sometimes this is the case with things like
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecuROM](SecuROM), which is a DRM system for games. This kind of DRM
will not work without an optical drive, and of course that is pretty rare these days.

### Dead Activation Servers.

Some games required activation servers, and would give you a small part of the game online in
response to you submitting an activation code. They would also track some PC details and limit
activations, so if you shared the game with a bunch of other people, the activations would fail.

### Obsolete Hardware.

Some games require specific hardware, and without it are no longer playable. This is rare these days,
but games like the PC version of [Star Fighter 3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fighter_(video_game)
would only be playable on [3DFX Voodoo cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DFX_Voodoo).

### Unsupported Operating Systems.

Some games are only playable on specific operating systems, and if you don't have that operating
system, you can't play the game. If that is an obsolete operating system, you will find that game hard to play.

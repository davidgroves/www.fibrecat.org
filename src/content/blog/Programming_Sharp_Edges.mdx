## What do I mean by a sharp edge ?

Tools can have sharp edges for two reasons, or for a combination of those two things.

1. Tools that NEED sharp edges. A saw or a kitchen knife without a sharp edge isn't very useful.
1. Paper !. Papercuts really hurt, and they are a side effect of how thin paper is, not a requirement.

Sharp edges in software engineering are usually a mixture of both. They often form an easy to use foot gun as well,
the kind of thing which lets you shoot yourself in the foot easily. You can obviously make mistakes with any tool.
You could in theory cut off your own foot with a saw but it would be quite hard to do so. However it is quite
easy to give yourself a papercut by mistake !

## This particular sharp edge.

To those familiar with Python, you may well have guessed what I'm going for here. It is **mutable defaults**. Here is
a very simple example.

```python
def append_to(element: any, to: list = []) -> list:
    to.append(element)
    return to

my_list = append_to(3, [1,2])
print(my_list)

my_other_list = append_to("c", ["a", "b"])
print(my_other_list)
```

This works as I think most people would expect, the result is 

```
[1, 2, 3]
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

Now, we repeat this but we use the fact the **append_to** has a default argument for the list to append to, which
is an empty list.

```
def append_to(element: any, to: list = []) -> list:
    to.append(element)
    return to

my_list = append_to(3)
print(my_list)

my_other_list = append_to("c")
print(my_other_list)
```

If you aren't familiar with this, you most likely expect the output to be

```
[3]
['c']
```

Even if you weren't already aware, you no doubt became suspicious because of the way I wrote this blog post.
What you actually get is.

```
[3]
[3, 'c']
```

## So what happened.

When you know, it is simple to see. When you create the function, a list variable is created called **to**,
bound to the function and set to the value of the empty list. When the function is called for the first time,
that list is mutated, and the 3 is appended to the end of it. Then, when it is called for the second time,
**THAT SAME LIST** is mutated again and now it becomes [3, 'c'].

In some circumstances, this might be what a person wanted, but I would say in >99% of cases it isn't, and this
kind of behaviour just creates a bug. It is so common a bug that tools like 
[pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) give a warning for it, 
[W102](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/dangerous-default-value.html)

## What should be done.

Ideally, this kind of defect should be something that causes the program to not work. It being an error you
can catch with a linter is good, and I would configure a linter to make this a hard error and not
allow the code to be checked into a CI system.

However we saw from how very painful the Python2 â†’ Python3 transition was that making backwards compatbile
breaking changes in a programming language, no matter how good an idea they seem, can come with the gnashing
of teeth and all kinds of suffering.

I also cannot think of a realistic scenario where code like this would be useful, and even if someone found one
in code I was reviewing, I'd look to find a clearer way to express it. The code might be clear to the
Python interpretator, but it I don't think it has ever been clear to human beings !

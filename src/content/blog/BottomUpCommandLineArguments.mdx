## What are CLI Arguments ?

CLI Arguments are the arguments you pass to a program when you run it. They have some conventions around how they work, but they are not a standard. Different programs may have different rules.

For example, the `ls` command, which lists files, has a `-l` option to list in long format or a `-a` option to list all files including hidden files. The `git` command has a `add`, `commit` and `pull` subcommands. Many programs have a `--help` option which prints out help information, and a `--version` option which prints out the version of the program, but not all.

## What is responsible ?

The program itself is responsible for parsing the arguments. Usually you will use a library to do this, such as [getopt](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html) in C, [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) in Python or [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) in Rust. However you can also do this in a more raw way, for example by examining the [sys.argv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv) list in Python.

## Most basic example.

Lets start by making a very basic example. We will write a program that does nothing, and then dump its memory space while it is running and examine it, looking for the arguments it was passed.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    printf("PID: %ld\n", (long)getpid());
    sleep(180);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

This is a very simple C program, it just sleeps for 180 seconds, and then exits. So what happens if we run it with some
command line arguments ?. Well, outside a boring wait to check, nothing.

```shell
$ gcc -o sleep sleep.c
$ ./sleep QWERTYUIOP
PID 54225
<3 min wait>
$ echo $?
0
```

So lets dump the memory space of this program while it is running (which is why it has the long sleep in it).

```shell
$ ./sleep ThisIsALongMessageIHopeICanFind
PID 129031

$ gdb -p 129031
(gdb) attach 129031
Attaching to process 129031
...

(gdb) info proc mappings
(gdb) info proc mappings
process 129031
Mapped address spaces:

          Start Addr           End Addr       Size     Offset  Perms  objfile
      0x558171563000     0x558171564000     0x1000        0x0  r--p   /home/dwg/CODE/playpen/sleep
      0x558171564000     0x558171565000     0x1000     0x1000  r-xp   /home/dwg/CODE/playpen/sleep
      ...
      ...
      0x7ffd4de56000     0x7ffd4de77000    0x21000        0x0  rw-p   [stack]

(gdb) x/-96s 0x7ffd4de77000
0x7ffd4de7615a:	""
0x7ffd4de7615b:	"./sleep"
0x7ffd4de76163:	"ThisIsALongMessageIHopeICanFind"
0x7ffd4de76183:	"SHELL=/bin/bash"
0x7ffd4de76193:	"EDITOR=vim"
```

### What, what did we do ?

- We ran the sleep program with a long command line argument. 
- We ran gdb, and attached to the process.
- We looked at the memory mappings allocated to the process.
- We found the stack.
- We inspected the memory (the x part),
  - We looked at the stack (the 0x7ffd4de77000 part, which is the end address of the stack)
  - starting form the bottom (the -96) part
  - and we looked for strings (the s part).

And doing this we found our command line argument on the stack, and we also found our environment variables as well.

We can confirm this, by repeating the process with two command line arguments, and seeing what we get. I'll shortcut this.

```shell
$ ./sleep CommandLineArgument1 CommandLineArgument2
PID 129031

$ gdb -p 129031
(gdb) attach 129031
(gdb) info proc mappings
(gdb) x/-96s 0x7ffcac2c4000
0x7ffcac2c3151:	"./sleep"
0x7ffcac2c3159:	"CommandLineArgument1"
0x7ffcac2c316e:	"CommandLineArgument2"
0x7ffcac2c3183:	"SHELL=/bin/bash"
0x7ffcac2c3193:	"EDITOR=vim"
```

I recently worked with a client who is building out a development team of roughly 10
people for a technically focused big-data / AI startup. While they mostly brought me in
to look at cloud vs self hosting options for hardware for training [ANN's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network),
I also ended up getting involved in quite a wide discussion on what hardware they should be buying for the developers.

We came to the conclusion that there are three primary options for this.

1. Give every developer a stipend, and allow them to buy what they want.
2. Give everyone the same hardware, and specify that hardware.
3. Creating an "internal shop", as a hybrid of option 1 and 2.

While I am a big fan of the first option, I understand this isn't something for every organisation, and it wasn't an option here.

Here is where I feel like organisations often make significant failings. This company were hiring and experienced engineers, 
and would be paying in the order of €8,000 to €10,000 per month on salaries alone for them.

The initial plan called for buying developer laptops costing around €1,300. These were 
[Dell XPS 13](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptops/xps-13-plus/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop) machines, with mostly default choices. 
Upgrading the memory from 8GB to 32GB, and upgrading the SSD from 512GB to 2TB cost a total of around €600, or around 2 days
of what you would pay these engineers.

There are so many advantages to giving technical staff good quality equipment.

- Whenever the computer is the slow point, people can get distracted and productivity will decline.
- Things like compiling can actually be slow. I have felt like this [XKCD Cartoon](https://xkcd.com/303/) even recently while working on some large rust codebases.
- Snappier user experiences in large repos for tools like [LSP's](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) just make everything feel nicer to use.
- The engineers feel valued when you give them nice tools !

So, while it is easy to look at something like 10 x €600 = €6000 and see that real cost, I'd advise everyone buying equipment for engineers to really consider
if that saving will be worth it in the long run. In this particular case, the savings on these significant hardware upgrades for all 10 of your engineers
is still going to be less than what you are paying one of them in a single month. The correct choice may be to make savings on this hardware, but I think
larger organisations often do make significant false economies in this area.

## Why A Python Project Skeleton?

I like [Python](https://www.python.org/) as a high level language, and in the places I tend to work (systems engineering, data science and machine learning) it is one of the most popular languages. However, unlike a language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which comes with tooling in the form of [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), Python is a bit more "bare bones" and leaves a lot of choices open to the developer.

## My choices.

- I use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as my primary tool. It is aiming to be Cargo for Python, and since this is what I am looking for, it is the best tool for me over other choices like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) / [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

- I use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) as my test framework.
- I use [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) as my linter and formatter.

## Setup.

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) should be installed globally on your system, as per its [installation instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).

## Creating a new project.

```bash
$ uv init --package --project $PROJECTNAME --vcs git --app
```

Replace `--app` with `--lib` if you are creating a library you only intend to import, and `--package` if you want to create an importable package.

This will :-

- Create a new directory called `PROJECTNAME`.
- Create a new git repository in that directory.
- Create a new virtual environment called `.venv`in that directory.
- Create the project directory structure.
  - A `src` directory for your source code.
  - A `pyproject.toml` file with all the project metadata.

## Installing dev tools/dependencies.

To install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) and [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) as dev tools, run the following. I also use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type checking.

```bash
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ uv add --dev pytest
$ uv add --dev ruff
$ uv add --dev mypy
```

You can expand this for any other dev tools you want to use, which aren't needed when the package is deployed.

## Installing dependencies.

To install dependencies, run the following.

```bash
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ uv add PACKAGENAME
```

You can run `uv add --help` to get extra information, including how to install optional components of a package (like the `standard` in `fastapi\[standard\]`).

## Writing and Running Tests.

You should make a `tests/` directory in the root of your project. Then create files called `test_SOMETHING.py` in that directory. Those tests should import the modules they are testing. These tests must import the package as it is installed, not simple as a local path.

Fo example `import PROJECTNAME.main` is required, but `import PROJECTNAME` is not. This is useful over other setups, as you are always testing the package as it is installed, free from any local defects.

Then you should run the tests with `uv run pytest`, or by activating the virtual environment and running `pytest` from there.

## Formatting and Linting.

To format your code, run `uv run ruff format .`. To lint your code, run `uv run ruff check .`.
You can use `uv run ruff check --fix .` to apply only safe fixes, and `uv run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .` to apply potentially unsafe fixes.

## Shell Script.

To put all this into practice, I have `new_python_project.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a new python project.
# Usage: new_python_project.sh PROJECTNAME

set -e

PROJECTNAME=$1

if [ -z "$PROJECTNAME" ]; then
	echo "Usage: new_python_project.sh PROJECTNAME"
	exit 1
fi

# Create the project directory.
uv init --package --project $PROJECTNAME --vcs git --app

# Add the dev dependencies.
uv add --dev pytest
uv add --dev ruff
uv add --dev mypy
uv sync

# Create the tests directory and add an example test file.
mkdir $PROJECTNAME/tests

cat << EOF
import $PROJECTNAME.main

def test_add():
	assert $PROJECTNAME.main.add(1, 1) == 2
EOF > $PROJECTNAME/tests/test_main.py
```

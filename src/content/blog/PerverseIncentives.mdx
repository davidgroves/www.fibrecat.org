## What are perverse incentives ?

To quote the Oxford English Dictionary, a normal incentive is "Something that encourages you to do something". Perverse incentives are where the incentive is designed to make encourage you to do something, but it actually encourages you to do something else. 

## An old example.

My favourite example is the [The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanoi_Rat_Massacre). Hanoi, now the capital of Vietnam was at the time a French colony. The city had a significant rat problem and as an attempt to solve it, the governer placed a bounty on rats. The idea was that instead of ignoring rats, citizens would be incentivised to kill them in order to collect the bounty. While somewhat succesful, it did motivate many people to do exactly that, and to setup traps and poison to kill the rats, it also incentivised another group of people to so something very different. They instead started to breed rats, and rats breed quickly, usually giving birth to 6-12 rats roughly every month.

## Examples from my past.

I once worked for a [NOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) manager who was exceptionally fixated on the number of tickets that individuals worked on. However the ticket allocation system in that NOC was simply that anyone could view a new "unclaimed" ticket that had come in. This created the incentive to "snipe" simple tickets to claim for yourself, while any complex ticket that would take a long time to work on would be ignored by everyone unitl the NOC manager had to force it on someone. Despite repeatedly pointing out how his staff evaluations directly lead to this behaviour he never changed it.

If were born in the early 80's or earlier, you can likely skip the next paragraph. Otherwise, here is some context.

Before [Google](https://www.google.com/) always became the answer for looking up a companies phone number, directory enquiries services existed. In the UK they used to be run by the national telecoms provider [British Telecom](https://www.bt.com/), but later this was privatised into multiple competitors. You would call a phone number, back in the day this was `192`, and speak to an operator. That operator would use phone books initially, and later a computerised system, to look up the phone number and read it out to you to write down. In the later days, they could put you through directly without you needing to redial.

One of the privitised companies measured employees on the speed with which they handled calls. What they didn't bother to check is if the person answered those calls accurately. Obviously mistakes would be made both by the operators (misreading a number, looking up the wrong company), or by the customers (they asked for the wrong data, misheard the operators response or transcribed it wrong). So this employee performed admirably by the metrics he was being measured on, but the metric didn't acurately reflect the actual performance of the employee. 

## Social Media Perverse Incentives.

What we all want from social media is a platform that allows us to connect with people and follow our friends and people we are interested in. Of course, the incentive of the social media platforms is instead to monetise us, and to extract as much money from our use of the platform as possible. This can be done through advertising, through selling our data.

Similarly when a "professional" social media poster makes content, what incentives do they have ?. Growing an account might be one, but those incentives are tied deeply to the desires of the social media platform. You can only bring yourself success in terms of shared revenue by bringing success to the platform, and so a feedback loop is created. This doesn't always mean you make "good" content though, just content ["the algorithm"](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-algorithm/) likes enough to show to people, and they like enough to engage with.

This can result in top tier content rising to the top, but it can also result in the low quality ["engagement bait"](https://newslit.org/educators/civic-blog/what-is-engagement-bait/) content that seems to be ever more popular. This can be as simple as "like for yes, share for no", or posts that are designed to trigger a more viceral response. Sometimes this is doubling down on a politically contentious topic, or the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) "questions" that are clear engagement bait.

This for example


## Idealistic Outcome.

In the ideal world, the incentives and the metrics used to measure those would be based on the common good, and everyone involved would agree on what that common good was. Of course, this is impossible as people will simply not agree on the "good" outcome. However, in the real world these metrics and incentives are based on maximising the profit of the companies engaged in this, and with this lack of alignment we are in the natual state of things.

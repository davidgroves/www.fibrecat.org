## Source of this question.

My mother have never been someone interested in mathematics, science or technology. In fact, she can
barely type, and when she got her first job at a school that required her to use a computer mouse,
I had to give a 60 year old instruction on how to use one in the 2010's.

At that school during a break, she heard several teachers discussing the 
[Einstein tile](https://www.livescience.com/newly-discovered-einstein-tile-is-a-13-sided-shape-that-solves-a-decades-old-math-problem)
discovery made by David Smith. The topic of this conversation drifted from the tile problem itself to the nature of mathematical proof.
The question I got from my mother, after a little back and forward, could be summarised as "what does a mathematician mean by proof".

One thing to note, these Einstein tiles have nothing to do with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein),
but are about covering a surface with a single tile. Google translate will turn "One Stone" into "Ein Stein", although some
german speaking friends of mine have said the one stone translation is a bit of a stretch.

## Multiple meanings of proof.

Most people know there are multiple types of proof. A good example, and a particularly good one for my mother as she used to work in
the legal system in England, is the idea of the level of proof needed to win a court case.

In the UK and many other western legal systems there are two standards of proof. If you are accused of a crime, several things are true.

- You are presumed to be innocent. Hence "You are innocent until proven guilty".
- The prosecution must convince the court that you are "guilty beyond reasonable doubt". That isn't particularly well defined but two
definitions I've heard used by judges are "so convinced of guilt that you are sure", and "99% convinced".

If however you are in a civil rather than criminal case, for example you are sued for failing to fufil a contract, then the burden of
proof is different. The burden to prove the case is on the side of that brings the case, but the requirement on the proof is lower.
In the UK it is officially "on the balance of probability". In other words, simply that you are more likely to be correct than not.
You could also classify this as "51%" sure.

## What is the mathematicians standard of proof.

Interestingly, it is even more strict than the proof standards in criminal court. It is, as close as is possible to be requiring
100% certainty.

## Some preamble.

I'm specifically looking at if you should trust various installation methods, and the risks involved in each of them.
I am assuming everything is being done "correctly" here, so for example all file downloads are via HTTPS with verified
signatures, and where applicable [checksums](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/deb-pack-sign.en.html)
are verified for the files obtained.

## Which of these actions is feels safe ?

I asked a straw poll of bout 5 other network engineers, system engineers and software developers, which of
of these methods they felt most "safe" using when installing some piece of new software on a Debian Based
Linux distribution. In this statistically insignificant and totally selection biased based poll,  

#### A. Feels nearly 100% safe.

```
#### Installing from the main Debian Repository
$ sudo apt install firefox-esr
```

#### B. Feels mostly safe.

```
#### Installing from sources direct from major project.
$ curl https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.18/bind-9.18.18.tar.xz
$ tar xf bind-9.18.18.tar.xz
$ cd bind-9.18.18
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

#### C. Feels less safe

```
#### Installing VSCode from a 3rd party Repository
$ wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
$ sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
```

#### D. Feels dangerous

```
#### Running install script
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## How dangerous are each of these things ?

#### A. The Debian Package install.

```
#### Installing from the main Debian Repository
$ sudo apt install firefox-esr
```

Everyone voted this to be the most safe option and I generally agree at least for important
packages like firefox.

It is important to realise that when installing 
any package using `apt`, or `rpm` or most other unix package manager systems, you are in effect installing 
arbitary code that could run at any privilege level, and could in principle replace any binary
on your system with a bad one. You can do some things to mitigate these risks.

For example before installing a package, you can look at what will be installed :-

```
$ sudo apt install --download-only firefox-esr
$ dpkg -c /var/cache/apt/archives/firefox-esr_115.2.0esr-1_amd64.deb
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-08-29 22:03 ./usr/bin/
-rwxr-xr-x root/root       118 2023-08-29 22:03 ./usr/bin/firefox
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2023-08-29 22:03 ./usr/bin/firefox-esr -> ../lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr
...
```

So that sounds scary, why do I agree it is the safest option. Well, it is something like what
[Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond) 
named [Linus' Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) in his 1997 essay,
[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar). In
that essay he says that many eyes make bugs shallow, and that being able to watch the development
process happen in public means people will find these bugs.

I think the odds of this happening with a big and popular Debian package like Firefox is quite low.
In fact, to my knowledge no Debian package that comes from the official repositories has ever 
shipped Malware.

That doesn't mean it hasn't happened in other linux distributions though. [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) 
shipped a trojan'd version of the [unrealircd IRC server](https://www.unrealircd.org/). 
You can see the details of this at this [bug report](https://bugs.gentoo.org/323691).

It is also true that while not strictly speaking Malware, and never having shipped in an
actual production release, but only beta builds, bugs have been shipped in official packages that would
destroy systems. I find this [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1202858)
in a beta of the [Squid web cache](http://www.squid-cache.org/) for 
[RedHat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux).

<blockquote>
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to RHEL 6.7 beta host with squid installed
2. Start squid using `sudo service squid start`
3. Restart squid using `sudo service squid restart`

Expected results: Squid is restarted.

Actual results: All files are deleted on the machine.
</blockquote>

While this wouldn't be malware in the way most people define it, the results certainly would be similar to some malware !

#### B. The install from source.

```
#### Installing from sources direct from major project.
$ curl https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.18/bind-9.18.18.tar.xz
$ tar xf bind-9.18.18.tar.xz
$ cd bind-9.18.18
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

In some ways, I would say this is MORE secure than the Debian package. The artifact you are installing is
always in source code form, so there is no need to check the binary you are installing is 
[reproducable](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/prevention/reproduciblebuilds.html)
by the source code in the [Debian source package](https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/SourcePackage).

You of course have to be concerned about your compiler being bad. [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson),
one of the computer scientist with the strongest resume, being at least partly responsible for [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix),
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) and the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/), wrote about this in a 
[1984 paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf).

However you had this fear in the case of the binary package, it just wasn't YOUR compiler you needed to worry about, but
the compiler on whatever system built the binary. The person that built the package may in principle at least be creating
malware without even knowing it, just as you might if you have a dirty compiler.

#### C. Installing from a 3rd party repository.

```
#### Installing VSCode from a 3rd party Repository
$ wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
$ sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
```

Should you trust third party repo's less than the official operating system repos ?. I do not believe that just because a package
comes from a third party repo it is inheritently less trustworthy. In fact, I'd be inclined to trust a major package like
[VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) from Microsoft over a more obscure Debian package that came directly from the
main Debian repo.

Microsoft have a [process to contribute to VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute), and it should
be quite challenging to get unreviewed malicious code into the source tree, and therefore into the binaries you would download.

I would say that you are safer installing something like VSCode than you are something like say 
[Weborf](https://ltworf.github.io/weborf/). I have no reason at all to suspect that 
[Salvo 'LtWorf' Tomaselli](https://ltworf.github.io/) is a bad guy, but if he was, or if someone compromised his computer systems,
that would be all it would take to compromise both the source code for this project on github or the binary Debian package
that he maintains.

#### D. Installing from a script.

```
#### Running install script
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This looks pretty damn dangerous at face value. You are grabbing a shell script from the internet and just blindly executing it.
However, I'll say this is significantly less dangerous than it looks. Firstly, you can choose to not pipe the results into `sh`, and
download and examine the shell script for sanity. Secondly, unlike the other three processes here, this only runs as your user.
Assuming you have a default sudo configuration, and haven't used sudo recently, if the shell script tries to run as root you
are going to face a password prompt. It can still do a bunch of nastyness, but only whatever your user could do. Of course a 
bad actor with full control of a user account that is in the wheel group or can use sudo isn't that far away from 
gaining root access anyway.

## Further Problems.

This specifically has talked about things that are either going to ship as OS packages, or might do if you didn't decide to
compile them from source, or install them from a different sources.

There is significantly more to say about other sources of software, specifically those from langauge specific package
management systems such as [pypi for Python](https://pypi.org/) or [NPM for Javascript](https://www.npmjs.com/). How to safely
manage installs from those ecosystems is an entire article to itself.

## Takeaway.

There is no such thing as a 100% safe install, but hopefully this blog post has given you some things to think about when deciding
if you should use something or not.

Don't take a kneejerk reaction to a particular install method. Think about the actual risks involved, what privilege level you will
execute any code at, how many people will have been involved in the review of the code you are fetching and executing, how well
managed and reviewed the process is for the packages creation.

Also consider your paranoia level. If you work at Redhat and maintain build servers, you should 100% be worried about backdoored compilers.
Bad actors have a lot to gain from compromising a build systems compiler. If you have just installed an OS from an ISO image, I would worry
significantly less about it. It is unlikely your compiler is backdoored, or if it is, so is everyone elses that is using that distribution
and that will no doubt be discovered rather quickly. You might have a mess to clean up, but you should know about that mess.

## What are host keys.

To avoid confusion, lets start with what the are not. They aren't user keys.
### User keys (not host keys)

- Split into public and private parts.
- Stored (on unix like systems), usually in `.ssh/id_rsa` + `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- For more modern eliptic curve based keys in files like `.ssh/id_ed25519` + `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
- Should have a passphare.
- Should be used with an ssh-agent.

SSH user keys might be a good future blog post, but they aren't for this one.

### What ACTUALLY are host keys.

If a user key identifies a user, a host key as the name suggests identifies a host. When
you make an SSH connection to a computer, how can you be sure it is the computer you think it is ?

In the world of the web, we have the HTTPS protocol, and SSL certificates to ensure some bad
actor between you and the system you are trying to connect to isn't intercepting your connection.

The typical infrastucture around SSH isn't quite so sophisticated, but it is designed to deliver
the same kind of idea. That you can trust you really are connecting to the system you think you are.

### Connecting to a system for the first time.

Using standard tools and default configs, if you connect to a system for the very first time, 
you will expect to see something like this.

```
$ ssh testhost.fibrecat.org
The authenticity of host 'testhost.fibrecat.org (172.27.3.4)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:UmQzMRW57s+3ZZVUwo+6dpDjLzTK5PGp8O6odlG0upY.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

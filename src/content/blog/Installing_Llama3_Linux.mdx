## What is Llama3 ?

[Llama3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/) is an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/), [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) from [Meta](https://about.meta.com/uk/).

It is similar to the much more famous [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt).

## Why would you want it ?

Lots of reasons, but mostly so you can locally get ChatGPT like answers to questions, without the need for the internet, any per-use costs or subscriptions fees.

I was installing it as part of a work project to translate intense numerical datasets into human readable reports.

I built the [ollama](https://ollama.com/) "LLM Manager" software from source, as I needed to make some tweaks.

## Install.

This is exactly what worked for me, with the following setup. Your mileage may vary with different systems and setups.

1. Debian12
1. Nvidia RTX 4080 with Nvidia closed source linux drivers.

Confirm your nvidia card is detected with 

```
$ nvidia-smi
```

Critically, the top line must have a CUDA version in it, like `NVIDIA-SMI 535.161.08 Driver Version: 535.161.08   CUDA Version: 12.2`.
If you aren't running this succesfully, solve your Nvidia install issues before continuing.

Then install packages needed to build ollama from.

```
$ sudo apt install golang cmake ninja-build cmake-doc cmake-format bzr build-essential git curl
```

Clone the ollama repo.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ollama/ollama.git
```

Build it.

```
$ cd ollama
$ go generate ./...
$ go build
```

Then test it, and download the llama3 model. This will download a very large file and might take a bit of time.

```
# In Terminal1
$ ollama serve

# In Terminal2
$ ollama run llama3
> Test Commands.
# Use CTRL-D to quit.
```

## Setup to run as a service.

This will make ollama run as system service, allowing anyone to use it without it running on a terminal.

First create a user for ollama to run as.

```
$ sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -d /usr/share/ollama ollama
$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/ollama
$ sudo chown ollama:ollama /usr/share/ollama
$ sudo chmod 700 /usr/share/ollama
```

Then create a ollama service definition file.

```
$ sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Ollama Service
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
User=ollama
Group=ollama
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF
```

Copy the ollama3 binary you built into /usr/local/bin

```
$ sudo cp ollama /usr/local/bin
```

Start it. First, close down the testing terminal you ahd running llama3 before

```
$ sudo service ollama start
```
## Test directly.

This will download the llama3 model again, this time to shared space. You could copy this from your homedir to speed it up if needed.

```
$ ollama run llama3
```

## Test using the REST API

```
$ curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt":"Echo back the phrase: testing llama3"
}'
```

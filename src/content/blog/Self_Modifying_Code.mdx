## What is self modifying code.

It is like the name itself suggests, code which as part of what it is designed to do when you run it, modifies itself.
It is now considered an extreme optimisation for most development, and somethng that should in general be avoided. It used to be much
more common though, and is still something used in the embeded software industry where every byte of memory or every clock cycle
counts.

## A bad high level example.

Here is an example in Python that uses the [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) standard library functions in
order to swap in an operator based on changes in the state of the program. I say this is a bad example as it isn't **really** an example of self
modifying code, as it the actual code run doesn't change, but it kind of looks like it does to the reader of the program.

This program will count up from 0 to 10, then count back down to 0 again and repeat this ad infinitum.

```python
import operator
import time

op = operator.add
i = 0

while True:
    print(i)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    i = op(i, 1)
    
    if i >= 10:
        op = operator.sub
    if i <= 0:
        op = operator.add
```

## A C example using function pointers.

This does the same thing in C, but it uses function pointers to swap between the increment and decrement functions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int i = 0;

int increment(int x) {
    return x + 1;
}

int decrement(int x) {
    return x - 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    /* Make a function pointer, starting out pointing at increment */
    int (*op)(int);
    op = increment;

    while (1) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        usleep(200 * 1000);
        i = op(i);
        if (i >= 10) {
            op = decrement;
        }
        if (i <= 0) {
            op = increment;
        }
    }
}
```

Because we wrote this in C, we can prove that it is indeed not self modifying either by examining the assembly produced
while compiling it. This however is quite complex, even for a trivial example like this. Compiling this program to assembly with 
`$ gcc -O0 -S -o no_self_mod.asm no_self_mod.c` produces over 100 lines of AMD64 assembly. Expand the section below to view
this assembly if you care.

## Problems with self modifying code.

I'm going to do a demo of self modifying code in a moment, but first I'm going to explain why I'm not doing it in a modern OS and a modern
set of tools, with a modern dialect of assembly like x64 or ARM64.

There are many reasons that self modifying code is considered harmful and or dangerous.

1. It is **REALLY** hard to understand. Much more if you don't expect it. Even more if you have no idea of the concept. This is most certiainly the type of
dirty programming technique you need to write comments around !

2. Modern operating systems make it hard to use. Tools such as Microsoft Windows 
[arbitary code guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference?view=o365-worldwide#arbitrary-code-guard), 
or Linux with [W^X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX) are designed to prevent security problems by literally preventing self modifying code.

The Linux kernel itself makes extensive use of self modification, as shown in 
Evgeniy Paltsev's [presentation to the embedded linux conference in 2019](https://elinux.org/images/b/be/SelfModifyngCode-rc6-public-slides.pdf), but the kernel
itself is in an ideal place to do so and to make use of the advantages of doing so.

## My example.

This uses the [Masswerk 6502 simulator](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html) to create and step through a program designed to do
the same thing as the previous examples, but to do so in a self modifying way.

```
LDX #$00    ; Load 0 into the X register
mainloop:
NOP         ; Do nothing, imagine this is the "print"
INX         ; Increment X, this code ends up at location 0x0003.
CPX #$0A    ; Compare X with 10.
BEQ setdec  ; Jump to self mod if 10.
CPX #$00    ; Compare X with 0.
BEQ setinc  ; Jump to self mod if 0.
JMP mainloop ; Go around loop again.

setinc:
LDY #$E8    ; Put the bits for the INX instruction in the Y register.
STY $0003   ; Store this in the INX location in the main code, the third line.
JMP mainloop  ; Jump back to main code.

setdec:
LDY #$CA    ; Put the bits for the DEX instruction in the Y register
STY $0003   ; Store this in the INX location in the main code, the third line.
JMP mainloop  ; Jump back to main code
```

To experiment with this yourself.

1. Go to the [masswerk emulator](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html)
1. Paste in this assembly above into the "src" section.
1. Hit "Assemble".
1. Copy the resulting object code from the "object code" window.
1. Click "Show in Assembler".
1. Paste the object code into the RAM section, with "Strip Leading Addresses" ticked.
1. Click "Load Memory".
1. Click "Continuous Run"

Now you will be able to watch the value of `XR` climb up from 0 to 10 (A) and back again
over and over again, and it is doing so using self modifying code.

The two "functions", setinc and setdec both add an opcode to the Y register, and then
store this in the program code itself directly. This is still a bit of a contrived example,
you could obviously have these functions just increment and decrement X instead, but in
less contrived examples this can result in significant performance gains on systems like the
6502.

## Takeaways

Self modifying code is mostly a relic of the past, except in kernel development, or 
on embedded systems. These are certainly not things I do much of day to day or have much
experience with.

However, if you did need a brief introduction to the concept of self modifying code, 
I hope this blog post helped.

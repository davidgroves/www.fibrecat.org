## My summary of software testing.

1. It is using software to test and validate other software.
1. You make the tests either before, or alongside, writing the software itself.
1. You run the tests after every modification to the software, to check for regressions (things that used to work that now don't).
1. The tests are as much to make developing the software easier as they are to ensure the finished product is correct.

## Why am I writing this ?

I recently was involved in a meeting with a senior (both in age and position) manager who was now responsible
for managing a team of software engineers. This is despite having spent over 20 years in the field of accountancy and 
finance and self describing himself as having never touched anything to do with software engineering than the odd
complex excel macro and some BBC basic he wrote at school in the 1980's.

This article is written exactly for that audiance, someone who has limited to zero experience in the IT field,
but who needs a quick overview of what software testing is and how it is done.

This won't go into any real detail. The full field of automated software testing is a large and complex field, 
with a variety of opinions, this really is a 101 style introduction to what engineers are actually doing.

## Misconceptions.

The first misconception he held was you write software, then you test it, and then it is done. The analogy
he used was you might build a car headlight, a switch, and test that pressing the switch turns on the headlight. This
is a reasonable approximation of a unit test in software engineering, although if you were testing a headlight you wouldn't
want to use a real switch, but just "poke" the headlight the way a real switch would in the test.

## A Software Example

Here is a simple example in Python of light switch class.

```python
class Headlight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_on = False
    
    def on(self):
        self.is_on = True
        
    def off(self):
        self.is_on = False
        
    def toggle(self):
        self.is_on = not self.is_on
```

This lets you create Headlights, set them to be on with `on()`, which will change them from off -> on if it was off, or
just leave it on if it already was on. `off()` does the same in the other direction, and `toggle()` changes the state from
off -> on or on -> off. You can formalise this description of what a Headlight does by making code that tests these
behaviours. For example.

```python
def test_headlight_defaults_off():
    headlight = Headlight()
    assert headlight.is_on is False
    
def test_headlight_turned_on():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.on()
    assert headlight.is_on is True
    
def test_headlight_turned_on_twice():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.on()
    headlight.on()
    assert headlight.is_on is True

def test_headlight_turned_on_then_off():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.on()
    headlight.off()
    assert headlight.is_on is False

def test_headlight_turned_toggled_once():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.toggle()
    assert headlight.is_on is True

def test_headlight_turned_toggled_twice():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.toggle()
    headlight.toggle()
    assert headlight.is_on is False

def test_headlight_turned_toggled_thrice():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.toggle()
    headlight.toggle()
    headlight.toggle()
    assert headlight.is_on is True
```

So now we have a working Headlight, with automatic tests that confirm the on/off/toggle buttons do what we expect. You could decide to add more
tests, for example checking that pressing the on button, then toggling results in it becoming off.

```python
def test_headlight_on_then_toggle():
    headlight = Headlight()
    headlight.on()
    headlight.toggle()
    assert headlight.is_on is False
```

These tests can be run with an automatic tool, and the computer can check they all pass.

```
$ pytest example.py
collected 8 items
8 passed in 0.00s
```

## Why this is useful.

So far, this doesn't sound that different from the analogy. We have a headlight, we can test the controls for it work as expected to turn it
on and off. Where this really starts to come in useful is we can check this STILL works as expected as we add additional functionality,
or add new ways to control the headlights.

Suppose we add two common features seen in modern car headlights. We want to add full/half beam controls, and we want to add an new
automatic setting which uses ambient light sensors to turn the headlights on and off automatically.

If you for example changed the `is_on` from just True/False to a `status` flag, with three states and forgot about the toggle function,
your tests would fail and you would know you have more work to do. For example, this it might be quite natural to update this to.

```python
import enum

class Headlight_State(enum.Enum, str):
    FULL_BEAM = "full_beam"
    HALF_BEAM = "half_beam"
    OFF = "off"

class Headlight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = Headlight_State.OFF
    
    def on(self):
        self.state = Headlight_State.FULL_BEAM
    
    def half_beam(self):
        self.state = Headlight_State.HALF_BEAM
    
    def off(self):
        self.state = Headlight_State.OFF
        
    def toggle(self):
        self.state = not self.state
        
    @property
    def is_on(self):
        return False if self.state == Headlight_State.OFF else True
```

But `toggle()` now makes no sense. `True` and `False` have obvious negations, but the tri-state of the new `Headlight_State` does not.
If you make these changes and run the tests, you get failures such as

```
    def test_headlight_turned_toggled_twice():
        headlight = Headlight()
        headlight.toggle()
        print(headlight.state)
        headlight.toggle()
        print(headlight.state)
>       assert headlight.is_on is False
E       assert True is False
E        +  where True = <foo.Headlight object at 0x7fd2650f7910>.is_on
```

Now it is clear to the software engineer that there is something that used to work, which now doesn't, and they can quickly figure out
where to investigate and what to fix.

## Summary

Software testing isn't fullproof. As with almost any type of testing, it is only as good as what you test for and how accurate you make
those tests.

However, good accurate tests both improve the quality of the outcome, in terms of releasing code with fewer bugs, but also dramatically
improve the expreience and productivity of the software engineer. They can work faster, having more confidence the changes they are
making aren't impacting other areas of the project.

Software testing is a deep field, with a lot of anciliary topics, techniques, methods and controversies. The industry doesn't agree
on the correct way to do it, and not all people even think it should be done at all, but I strongly believe in using it in this
way on the kinds of projects I work on.

I hope if you read this and were in a similar position to my manager, you now have at least a basic understanding and will be able
to google your way to even more understanding if you need to.
